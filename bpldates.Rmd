## Inlezen data


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r getting data}
df <- as_tibble(read.csv2(fname, sep = ",", header = TRUE, colClasses = "character"))
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r freq 1}
table(df$FTR)
table(df$HomeTeam, df$FTR)
df1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(numdate = as.Date(Date,"%d/%m/%Y"))

year(df1$numdate) <- ifelse(year(df1$numdate) == 17, 2017,year(df1$numdate))
year(df1$numdate) <- ifelse(year(df1$numdate) == 18, 2018,year(df1$numdate))

df2 <- df1 %>%
  mutate(xmas = ifelse((month(numdate) == 12 && day(numdate) > 19),1, ifelse((month(numdate) == 1 && day(numdate) < 11), 1, 0)))
      

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
